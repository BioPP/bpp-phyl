 * @brief A empirico-parametric amino-acid substitution model.
 *
 * An empirical exchangeability matrix is used, and equilibrium frequencies are estimated in an economic way, using hyperparameters obtained with a PCA analysis of
 * proteins from the three domains of life.
 * This way really is economic mainly in non-homogeneous cases, when several matrices are used on a single tree topology.
 * _parameters is a list of parameters ordered as follows: first the axes probabilities, and then the sets of 20 equilibrium frequencies corresponding to these axes.
