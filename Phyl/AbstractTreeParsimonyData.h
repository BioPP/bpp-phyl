/**
 * @brief Partial implementation of the TreeParsimonyData interface.
 *
 * This data structure provides a simple compression, by performing and storing computations
 * only one time per identical sites.
 *
 * The compression is achieved by the TreeParsimonyScore object.
 * The correspondance between sites in the dataset and the arrays in the structures is given
 * by the _rootPatternLinks array: the array indice for site @f$i@f$ if given by:
 * @code
 * _rootPatternLinks[i]
 * @endcode
 *
 * Finally, the _rootWeights array gives for each array position, the number of sites with this
 * pattern.
 * The global parsimony score is then given by the sum of all scores for each array position,
 * weighted by the corresponding number of sites.
