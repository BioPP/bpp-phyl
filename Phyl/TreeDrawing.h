/**
 * @brief Basal interface for tree drawing classes.
 *
 * Basicly, a TreeDrawing object draw a graph of the tree and compute the coordinates
 * of each node on the graph. These coordinates may be retrieved by dedicated functions.
 * The drawing is performed on a GraphicDevice object.
 *
 * The TreeDrwing class is in charge of the tree reprensentation, and offer tools to retireve
 * the coordinates of nodes. Using these funcitons to plot annotation may turn to be unefficient
 * however, particularly for large trees, as they involve a search on the whole tree. For easier
 * tuning of the drawing extensions, the interface defines the drawProperty,
 * getSupportedDrawableProperties and isDrawable methods. These methods can be used to add features
 * to the plot. Adding new features can then be performed by subclassing an existing algorithm
 * and adding support for more properties.
 *
 * The TreeDrawing interface do not implies that the implementation works on a copy of the tree.
 * It takes a constant pointer toward the tree to plot. Depending on the implementation however,
 * the inheriting class may chose to store a copy of the tree for convenience. Refer to the
 * documentation of the specific implementation you are using for details.
