/**
 * @brief This class implement the 'traditional' way of computing likelihood for a tree.
 *
 * The substitution model is constant over the tree (homogeneous model).
 * A non uniform distribution of rates among the sites is allowed (ASRV models).</p>
 *
 * The Felsenstein recursive algorithm is used for conputation.
 * For each node, a likelihood tensor is defined, containing all likelihoods values for
 * for the substree defined by this node. The likelihood tensor dimension are defined as below:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Site</li>
 * <li>Rate class</li>
 * <li>Ancestral state</li>
 * </ul>
 * These tensors are stored into a map with each node as a key (cf. _likelihoods).
 *
 * The computation use <i>site patterns</i> for more efficiency.
 * Following N. Galtier (personal communication ;-), we define a Pattern as a distinct site
 * in a sub-dataset corresponding to the dataset with sequences associated to a particular subtree.
 * The likelihood computation is the same for a given site, hence the idea is to save time from
 * performing many times the same coputation.
 * The network between all patterns is defined by the _patternLinks double map, initialized in the
 * initLikelihoodsWithPatterns() method. This initialisation takes more time than the classic
 * initTreeLikelihood one, where all likelihoods for a given site <i>i</i> are at the <i>i</i> coordinate
 * in the likelihood tensor, but is really faster when computing the likelihood (computeLikelihoods() method).
 * Hence, if you have to compute likelihood many times while holding the tree topology unchanged,
 * you should use patterns. And since this is what you'll have to do in most case (for instance for parameter
 * estimation), we set this as the default method for now.
 * The second method is for testing purpose only.
 *
 * For topology estimation, consider using the DRHomogeneousTreeLikelihood class.
