This software needs cmake >= 2.8.12 to build.

After installing cmake, run it with the following command:
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=[where to install, for instance /usr/local or $HOME/.local] .

If available, you can also use ccmake instead of cmake for a more user-friendly interface.

Then compile and install the software with
make install

You may also consider installing and using the software checkinstall for easier system administration.
