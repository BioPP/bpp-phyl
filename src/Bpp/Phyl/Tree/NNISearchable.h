/**
 * @brief Interface for Nearest Neighbor Interchanges algorithms.
 *
 * This interface defines the methods to work with NNI algorithms.
 * 
 * NNISearchable objects are supposed to work with TreeTemplate objects.
 * NNI are defined as follow:
 * <pre>
 * ------------->
 *     +------- C
 *     |
 * D --+ X  +-- B
 *     |    |
 *     +----+ F
 *          |
 *          +-- A
 * </pre>
 * Where:
 * -F is the focus (parent) node,
 * -A and B are the son of F
 * -X is the parent of F and so on.
 * Two NNI's are possible for branch (XF):
 * - swaping B and C, which is the same as D and A
 * - swaping A and C, which is the same as D and B
 * Because of the rooted representation, we'll consider B \f$\leftrightarrow\f$ C and A \f$\leftrightarrow\f$ C,
 * which are simpler to perform.
 *
 * For unrooted tree, we have at the 'root' node:
 * <pre>
 * ------------->
 *   +------- D
 *   |
 * X +------- C
 *   |
 *   |    +-- B
 *   |    |
 *   +----+ F
 *        |
 *        +-- A
 * </pre>
 * In this case, we swap A or B with one of C or D.
 * Which one of C or D depends on the implementation, but will always be the same,
 * so that swapping A or B involve 2 distinct NNI.
