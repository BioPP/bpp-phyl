/**
 * @brief This class deals with the bipartitions defined by trees
 *
 * Any branch of a tree defines a bipartition, i.e. two non-overlapping subsets of leaves
 * whose union is the whole set of leaves. A tree topology can therefore be represented by
 * the list of bipartitions its branches define - the so-called matrix representation.
 * Coding trees this way is useful for comparing topologies, calculating topological distances,
 * producing consensus trees or super-trees, calculating bootstrap support.
 *
 * A BipartitionList includes a set of element names (typically leaf names) and a vector of arrays of bits
 * (int*, not bitsets, are used to allow for dynamic memory allocation). Each array of bit codes for one bipartition.
 * Each bit in an array of bit corresponds to one element, so the order of element names matter.
 * Bits set to zero versus bits set to one define the two partitions of elements.
 * A BipartitionList is called sorted if its elements (leaf names) are in alphabetic order (recommended).
 *
 * BipartitionList objects are typically created from a tree, in which case elements are leaf names.
 * Note that BipartitionList is an unrooted object: a rooted or unrooted versions of the same tree will
 * yield the same BipartitionList in which the root location is ignored. Bipartitions can be accessed as
 * arrays of bits (e.g. getBitBipartition), or as map<string, bool>, in which keys are leaf names and
 * true/false values define the two partitions (e.g. getBipartition, addBipartition).
