/**
 * @brief NNI topology search method.
 *
 * Several algorithm are implemented:
 * - Fast algorithm: loop over all nodes, check all NNIs and perform the corresponding change if it improve the score.
 *   When a NNI is done, reloop from the first node without checking the remaining ones.
 * - Better algorithm: loop over all nodes, check all NNIS.
 *   Then choose the NNI corresponding to the best improvement and perform it.
 *   Then re-loop over all nodes.
 * - PhyML algorithm (not fully tested, use with care): as the previous one, but perform all NNI improving the score at the same time.
 *   Leads to faster convergence.
