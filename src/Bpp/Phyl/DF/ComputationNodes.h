    /** Heterogeneous computation node.
     * Performs a computation with a fixed set of arguments of possibly different types.
     * This class wraps a function in a node type ready to be used.
     *
     * ArgumentTypes... represent the list of types of arguments used in the computation.
     * Callable must be a functor type (either manual, or a lambda).
     * (functor type is a type with an operator()(Args...) method).
     * The Callable function must have the following prototype:
     * @code{.cpp}
     * void func (ResultType & result, const Arg1Type & arg1, ..., const ArgNType & argN);
     * @endcode
     * With {Arg1Type, ..., ArgNType} being the types in the ArgumentTypes list.
     * The value is modified in place, to avoid reallocations if the type is a complex type like a vector.
     * Callable cannot be a function pointer, please wrap it into a FunctionPointerWrapper class.
     *
     * Each argument generates a dependency (something requesting a value).
     * All dependencies must be connected to producer nodes before we can compute the current node.
     * During computation, arguments values will be retrieved from the producers nodes by following the dependencies.
     * dependency<N> () returns a DependencyConnector object that can be used to connect/disconnect the N-th dependency.
     * 
     * An example of use is available in the test/test_dataflow.cpp file.
     *
     * EBO:
     * In most cases, compute functions will not use any data except their arguments (pure functions).
     * Thus the functors types will have a 0 size.
     * If the functor is an attribute, the compiler must make it 1 byte at least for reasons.
     * This loses space, more than 1 byte due to alignment.
     * Thus we use private inheritance, which lets the compiler make it really 0 size (empty base optimisation).
     * The only downside is that Callable must be a class type.
     * Function pointers are not class types, so we cannot use them.
     * FunctionPointerWrapper allow to use function pointers and have static linking to the function.
