/**
 * @brief The general multiple substitution model for codons, from
 * Zaheri & al, 2014.
 *
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * This model is built from one or several nucleotide substitution
 * models. It also allows distinct equilibrium frequencies between
 * codons. A multiplicative factor accounts for the selective
 * restraints at the amino acid level, depending on the synonymy of
 * the amino acids.
 *
 *
 * This model includes :
 *
 * - parameters of the nucleotide models, 
 * - @f$\omega@f$ for the ratio of non-synonymous vs synonymous
 * substitution rates,
 * - parameters of the equilibrium frequencies 
 
 * The codon frequencies @f$\pi_j@f$ are either observed or infered.
 *
 * Reference:
 * -  Zaheri, M. and Linda, D. and Salamin, N. A Generalized
 * Mechanistic Codon Model (2014).
