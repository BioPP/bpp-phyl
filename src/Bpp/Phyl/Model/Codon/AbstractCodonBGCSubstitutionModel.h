/**
 * @brief Abstract class for modelling of non-synonymous and
 * synonymous substitution rates in codon models, with gBGC.
 *
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * The non-synonymous substitution rate is multiplied with
 * @f$\frac{\epsilon B+S}{1-e^{-(\epsilon B+S)}}@f$.
 *
 * The synonymous substitution rate is multiplied with @f$\frac{\epsilon
 * B}{1-e^{-\epsilon B}}@f$.
 *
 * 
 * with positive parameter @f$S@f$ that stands for selection, and real
 * parameter @f$B@f$ for biased gene conversion. In the formula,
 * @f$\epsilon = 1@f$ for AT->GC substitutions, @f$\epsilon = -1@f$
 * for GC->AT substitution, and  @f$\epsilon = 0@f$ otherwise.
