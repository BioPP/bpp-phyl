/**
 * @brief The Yang and Nielsen (1998) substitution model for codons.
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * This model has one rate of transitions and one rate of
 * transversion. It also allows distinct equilibrium frequencies
 * between codons. A multiplicative factor accounts for the selective
 * restraints at the amino acid level, depending on the synonymy of
 * the amino acids.
 *
 * For codons @f$i=i_1i_2i_3@f$ and @f$j=j_1j_2j_3@f$, the generator
 * term @f$Q_{ij} (i \neq j)@f$ is:
 *
 * 0 if 2 or 3 of the pair @f$(i_1,j_1) (i_2,j_2) (i_3,j_3) @f$ are different.
 *
 * @f$\mu \pi_j \omega@f$ if exactly 1 of the pairs @f$(i_1,j_1)
 * (i_2,j_2) (i_3,j_3) @f$ is different, that difference is a
 * transversion and amino acids coded by i and j are different.
 *
 * @f$\mu \pi_j @f$ if exactly 1 of the pairs @f$(i_1,j_1) (i_2,j_2)
 * (i_3,j_3) @f$ is different, that difference is a transversion and
 * amino acids coded by i and j are the same.
 *
 * @f$\mu \kappa \pi_j \omega@f$ if exactly 1 of the pairs
 * @f$(i_1,j_1) (i_2,j_2) (i_3,j_3) @f$ is different, that difference
 * is a transition and amino acids coded by i and j are different.
 *
 * @f$\mu \kappa \pi_j @f$ if exactly 1 of the pairs @f$(i_1,j_1)
 * (i_2,j_2) (i_3,j_3) @f$ is different, that difference is a
 * transition and amino acids coded by @f$i@f$ and @f$j@f$ are the
 * same.
 *
 * @f$\mu@f$ is a normalization factor.
 *
 * This model includes 2 parameters (@f$\kappa@f$ and @f$\omega@f$).
 * The codon frequencies @f$\pi_j@f$ are either observed or infered.
