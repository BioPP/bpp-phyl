/**
 * @brief The RELAX (2014) branch-site model for codons
 * The model detects changes in selective pressure based on a prior partition of the tree branches provided by the user
 * @author Keren Halabi
 *
 * This model cocnsists of a mixture of models, each defined as described in YN98 class (will use kappa instead of 5 GTR parameters),
 * The mixture is defined in two levels: the site level and the branch level
 * The model consists of two site models - each one for a different branches group: brackground and foreground
 * The site model of the background group is a mixture of 3 MG94 models 
 * The YN98 (i.e, kappa) parameters, except for the omega value, are shared between the 3 sub-models
 * Each site can be assigned to one of 3 omega classes that correspond to the 3 selective regimes:
 * \omega_0 = omega_1 * p < 1 @f$ (with probability @f$p_0 @f$)
 * \omega_1 <= 1 @f$ (with probability @f$p_1 @f$)
 * \omega_2 > 1 @f$ (with probability 1-@f$p_1-@f$p_0 @f$)
 * The omegas of the foreground group are obtained by raising the omegas of the background group to the power of a selection intensity parameter k
 * Overall, the model consists of 9 parameters, base frequencies parameters excluded:
 * 5 parameters for the GTR model that is nested in the MG94 model (Currently, the model is implemented with a single kappa parameter rather than 5 GTR parameters)
 * 3 omega values parameters + 2 omega frequencies parameters
 * 1 selection intensity parameter k
