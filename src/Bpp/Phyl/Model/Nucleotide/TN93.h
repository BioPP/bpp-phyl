/**
 * @brief The Tamura and Nei (1993) substitution model for nucleotides.
 *
 * This model has two rate of transitions and one rate of transversion.
 * It also allows distinct equilibrium frequencies between A, C, G and T.
 * This models hence includes six parameters, two transition / transversion
 * relative rates \f$\kappa_1\f$ and \f$\kappa_2\f$, and four frequencies \f$\pi_A, \pi_C, \pi_G, \pi_T\f$.
 * These four frequencies are not independent parameters, since they have the constraint to
 * sum to 1. Usually, these parameters are measured from the data and not optimized.
 * \f[
 * S = \begin{pmatrix}
 * \cdots & r & \kappa_1 r & r \\ 
 * r & \cdots & r & \kappa_2 r \\ 
 * \kappa_1 r & r & \cdots & r \\ 
 * r & \kappa_2 r & r & \cdots \\ 
 * \end{pmatrix}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * \pi = \left(\pi_A, \pi_C, \pi_G, \pi_T\right)
 * \f]
 * This models hence includes five parameters, two transition / transversion
 * relative rates \f$\kappa_1, \kappa_2\f$ and four frequencies \f$\pi_A, \pi_C, \pi_G, \pi_T\f$.
 * These four frequencies are not independent parameters, since they have the constraint to
 * sum to 1.
 * We use instead a different parametrization to remove this constraint:
 * \f[
 * \begin{cases}
 * \theta = \pi_C + \pi_G\\
 * \theta_1 = \frac{\pi_A}{1 - \theta} = \frac{\pi_A}{\pi_A + \pi_T}\\
 * \theta_2 = \frac{\pi_G}{\theta} = \frac{\pi_G}{\pi_C + \pi_G}\\
 * \end{cases}
 * \Longleftrightarrow
 * \begin{cases}
 * \pi_A = \theta_1 (1 - \theta)\\
 * \pi_C = (1 - \theta_2) \theta\\
 * \pi_G = \theta_2 \theta\\
 * \pi_T = (1 - \theta_1)(1 - \theta).
 * \end{cases}
 * \f]
 * These parameters can also be measured from the data and not optimized.
 *
 * Normalization: \f$r\f$ is set so that \f$\sum_i Q_{i,i}\pi_i = -1\f$:
 * \f[
 * S = \frac{1}{P}\begin{pmatrix}
 * \frac{-\pi_T-\kappa_1\pi_G-\pi_C}{\pi_A} & 1 & \kappa_1 & 1 \\ 
 * 1 & \frac{-\kappa_2\pi_T-\pi_G-\pi_A}{\pi_C} & 1 & \kappa_2 \\ 
 * \kappa_1 & 1 & \frac{-\pi_T-\pi_C-\kappa_1\pi_A}{\pi_G} & 1 \\ 
 * 1 & \kappa_2 & 1 & \frac{-\pi_G-\kappa_2\pi_C-\pi_A}{\pi_T} \\ 
 * \end{pmatrix}
 * \f]
 * with \f$P=2\left(\pi_A \pi_C + \pi_C \pi_G + \pi_A \pi_T + \pi_G \pi_T + \kappa_2 \pi_C \pi_T + \kappa_1 \pi_A \pi_G\right)\f$.
 *
 * The normalized generator is obtained by taking the dot product of \f$S\f$ and \f$\pi\f$:
 * \f[
 * Q = S . \pi = \frac{1}{P}\begin{pmatrix}
 * -\pi_T-\kappa_1\pi_G-\pi_C & \pi_C & \kappa_1\pi_G & \pi_T \\ 
 * \pi_A & -\kappa_2\pi_T-\pi_G-\pi_A & \pi_G & \kappa_2\pi_T \\ 
 * \kappa_1\pi_A & \pi_C & -\pi_T-\pi_C-\kappa_1\pi_A & \pi_T \\ 
 * \pi_A & \kappa_2\pi_C & \pi_G & -\pi_G-\kappa_2\pi_C-\pi_A \\ 
 * \end{pmatrix}
 * \f]
 *
 * For now, the generator of this model is diagonalized numericaly.
 * See AbstractSubstitutionModel for details of how the porbabilities are computed.
 *
 * The parameters are named \c "kappa1", \c "kappa2", \c "theta", \c "theta1" and \c "theta2"
 * and their values may be retrieve with the command 
 * \code
 * getParameterValue("kappa1")
 * \endcode
 * for instance.
