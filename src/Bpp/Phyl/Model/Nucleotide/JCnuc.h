/**
 * @brief The Jukes-Cantor substitution model for nucleotides.
 *
 * All rates equal:
 * \f[
 * S = \begin{pmatrix}
 * \cdots & r & r & r \\
 * r & \cdots & r & r \\
 * r & r & \cdots & r \\
 * r & r & r & \cdots \\
 * \end{pmatrix}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * \pi = diag\left(\frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}\right)
 * \f]
 * Normalization: \f$r\f$ is set so that \f$\sum_i Q_{i,i}\pi_i = -1\f$:
 * \f[
 * S = \begin{pmatrix}
 * -4 & \frac{4}{3} & \frac{4}{3} & \frac{4}{3} \\
 * \frac{4}{3} & -4 & \frac{4}{3} & \frac{4}{3} \\
 * \frac{4}{3} & \frac{4}{3} & -4 & \frac{4}{3} \\
 * \frac{4}{3} & \frac{4}{3} & \frac{4}{3} & -4 \\
 * \end{pmatrix}
 * \f]
 * The normalized generator is obtained by taking the dot product of \f$S\f$ and \f$pi\f$:
 * \f[
 * Q = S . \pi = \begin{pmatrix}
 * -1 & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \\
 * \frac{1}{3} & -1 & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} \\
 * \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & -1 & \frac{1}{3} \\
 * \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & \frac{1}{3} & -1 \\
 * \end{pmatrix}
 * \f]
 *
 * The eigen values are \f$\left(0, -\frac{4}{3}, -\frac{4}{3}, -\frac{4}{3}\right)\f$,
 * the left eigen vectors are, by row:
 * \f[
 * U = \begin{pmatrix}
 *  \frac{1}{4} &  \frac{1}{4} &  \frac{1}{4} &  \frac{1}{4} \\
 * -\frac{1}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} &  \frac{3}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} \\
 * -\frac{1}{4} &  \frac{3}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} \\
 *  \frac{3}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} & -\frac{1}{4} \\
 * \end{pmatrix}
 * \f]
 * and the right eigen vectors are, by column:
 * \f[
 * U^-1 = \begin{pmatrix}
 * 1 &  0 &  0 &  1 \\
 * 1 &  0 &  1 &  0 \\
 * 1 &  1 &  0 &  0 \\
 * 1 & -1 & -1 & -1 \\
 * \end{pmatrix}
 * \f]
 *
 * In addition, a rate_ factor defines the mean rate of the model.
 *
 * The probabilities of changes are computed analytically using the formulas:
 * \f[
 * P_{i,j}(t) = \begin{cases}
 * \frac{1}{4} + \frac{3}{4}e^{-rate\_*\frac{4}{3}t} & \text{if $i=j$}, \\
 * \frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{4}e^{-rate\_*\frac{4}{3}t} & \text{otherwise}.
 * \end{cases}
 * \f]
 *
 * First and second order derivatives are also computed analytically using the formulas:
 * \f[
 * \frac{\partial P_{i,j}(t)}{\partial t} = rate\_ * \begin{cases}
 * -e^{-rate\_*\frac{4}{3}t}           & \text{if $i=j$}, \\
 * \frac{1}{3}e^{-rate*\frac{4}{3}t} & \text{otherwise}.
 * \end{cases}
 * \f]
 * \f[
 * \frac{\partial^2 P_{i,j}(t)}{\partial t^2} = rate\_^2 *\begin{cases}
 * \frac{4}{3}e^{-rate\_*\frac{4}{3}t}  & \text{if $i=j$}, \\
 * -\frac{4}{9}e^{-rate\_*\frac{4}{3}t} & \text{otherwise}.
 * \end{cases}
 * \f]
