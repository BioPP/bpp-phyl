/**
 * @brief Abstract Basal class for words of substitution models.
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * Objects of this class are built from several substitution models.
 * Each model corresponds to a position in the word. No model is
 * directly accessible.
 *
 * Only substitutions with one letter changed are accepted.
 *
 * There is one substitution per word per unit of time
 * on the equilibrium frequency, and each position has its specific rate.
 * For example, if there are @f$n@f$ models and \f$\rho_i\f$ is the rate of
 * model i (@f$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i = 1@f$):
 * @f{eqnarray*}
 * Q_{abc \rightarrow abd} &=& \rho_2 Q^{(2)}_{c \rightarrow d}\\
 * Q_{abc \rightarrow aed} &=& 0\\
 * @f}
 *
 * The parameters of this word model are the same as the ones of the
 * models used. Their names have a new prefix :
 *
 * If there is one model per position, "i_" where i stands for the
 * position in the word.
 *
 * If there is only one model, "123..._" where all positions are
 * enumerated.
