 * @brief Basal class for words of substitution models.
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * Only substitutions with one letter changed are accepted. Hence the
 * equilibrium frequency of each word is the product of the
 * equilibrium frequencies of the letters.</p>
 *
 * If there are @f$n@f$ models, @f$\rho_i@f$ is the rate of
 * model i (@f$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \rho_i = 1@f$) and the rates
 * are defined by relative rates parameters @f$r_i@f$
 * (called "relratei") with:
 * @f[
 * 1 <= i < n, \rho_i = (1-r_1).(1-r_2)...(1-r_{i-1}).r_{i}
 * @f]
 * @f[
 * \rho_n = (1-r_1).(1-r_2)...(1-r_{n-1})
 * @f]
 * and
 * @f[
 * \forall 1 <= i < n, r_i = \frac{\rho_i}{1-(\rho_1+...\rho_{i-1})}
 * @f]
 * where @f$\rho_i@f$ stands for the rate of position @f$i@f$.
