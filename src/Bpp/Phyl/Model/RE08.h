/**
 * @brief The Rivas-Eddy substitution model with gap characters.
 *
 * This model expends any reversible substitution model with gaps as an additional state.
 * Although the conditionnal subtitution process is reversible, the insertion/deletion process
 * needs not be. The model hence adds two parameters for insertion and deletions, @f$\lambda@f$ and @f$\mu@f$.
 * If we note @f$Q@f$ the (simple) transition matrix (= Markov generator) and @f$Q^\epsilon@f$ the extended one, we have: 
 * @f[
 * Q^\epsilon =
 * \left(
 * \begin{array}{ccc|c}
 * & & & \mu \\ 
 * & \rule{0cm}{1cm}\rule{1cm}{0cm}Q-\mu\delta_{ij} & & \vdots \\ 
 * & & & \mu \\
 * \hline
 * \lambda\pi_1 & \ldots & \lambda\pi_n & -\lambda \\ 
 * \end{array}
 * \right)
 * @f]
 * where @f$n@f$ is the number of states of the simple model (in most case equal to the size of the alphabet) and @f$(\pi_1,\ldots,\pi_n)@f$ is the vector of equilibrium frequencies of the conditional model.
 * @f$\delta_{ij}@f$ is 1 if i=j, 0 otherwise.
 * Note that in the original paper @f$Q@f$ is noted as @f$R@f$, and @f$Q_t@f$ is used for the probability matrix, which is referred here as @f$P^\epsilon(t)@f$ for consistency with the documentation of other models. 
 * 
 * The extended Markov model is reversible, and the equilibrium frequencies are
 * @f[
 * \pi^\epsilon = \left( \pi \cdot \frac{\lambda}{\lambda + \mu}, \frac{\mu}{\lambda + \mu}\right).
 * @f]
 * The corresponding exchangeability matrix is:
 * @f[
 * S^\epsilon = 
 * \left(
 * \begin{array}{ccc|c}
 * & & & \lambda + \mu \\ 
 * & \rule{0cm}{1cm}\rule{1cm}{0cm}(S - \frac{\mu\delta_{ij}}{\pi_i})\frac{\lambda+\mu}{\lambda} & & \vdots \\ 
 * & & & \lambda + \mu \\
 * \hline
 * \lambda + \mu & \ldots & \lambda + \mu & - (\lambda + \mu) \\ 
 * \end{array}
 * \right)
 * @f]
 * The eigen values and vectors are computed numerically, but the transition probabilities are computed analytically from the simple substitution model, together with the first and second order derivatives according to time.
 *
 * Please note that the original Rivas and Eddy method uses this substitution model with a modification of the Felsenstein algorithm.
