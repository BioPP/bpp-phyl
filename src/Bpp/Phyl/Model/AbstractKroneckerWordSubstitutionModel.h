  /**
   * @brief Abstract Kronecker Word Model.
   *
   * Objects of this class are built from several substitution models.
   * Each model corresponds to a position in the word. No model is
   * directly accessible.
   *
   * A substitution rate between words is the product of the rates of
   * changing letters of position generators.
   *
   * Either all substitutions are allowed, or any subset of them is
   * allowed. For example, in case of 3 words model, if @f$Q@f$ is the
   * generator of the position model, either all substitutions are
   * allowed (ie generator is @f$ Q_1 \otimes Q_1 \otimes Q_1 @f$ with
   * @f$Q_1@f$ is @f$Q@f$ with diagonal of 1), or all and only three
   * letters substitutions are allowed (ie generator is @f$ Q_0
   * \otimes Q_0 \otimes Q_0 @f$ with @f$Q_0@f$ is @f$Q@f$ with
   * diagonal of 0), or all and only two letters substitutions are
   * allowed (generator is @f$ I \otimes Q_0 \otimes Q_0 + Q_0 \otimes
   * I \otimes Q_0 + Q_0 \otimes Q_0 \otimes I @f$), or all and only
   * two neighbors letters substitutions are allowed (generator is @f$
   * I \otimes Q_0 \otimes Q_0 + Q_0 \otimes Q_0 \otimes I @f$).
   *
   * Default construction is all substitutions, but a vector of
   * vectors of simultaneously changing positions can be given.
