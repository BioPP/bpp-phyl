/**
 * @brief Transition models defined as a mixture of several
 * substitution models.
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * All the models can be of different types (for example T92 or
 * GY94), and each model has a specific probability and rate.
 *
 *
 * The probabilities and rates of the models are independent
 * parameters, handled directly, under the constraint that the
 * expectation of the rates on the distribution of the models must
 * equal one.
 *
 * If there are @f$n@f$ models, @f$p_i@f$ is the probability of
 * model i (@f$\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i = 1@f$) and the probabilities
 * are defined by relative probabilities parameters @f$rp_i@f$
 * (called "relprobai") with:
 * @f[
 * 1 <= i < n, p_i = (1-rp_1)*(1-rp_2)...(1-rp_{i-1})*rp_{i}
 * @f]
 * @f[
 * p_n = (1-rp_1)*(1-rp_2)...(1-rp_{n-1})
 * @f]
 * and
 * @f[
 * \forall 1 <= i < n, rp_i = \frac{p_i}{1-(p_1+...+p_{i-1})}
 * @f]
 * where @f$p_i@f$ stands for the probability of model @f$i@f$.
 *
 *
 * If there are @f$n@f$ models, @f$\rho_i@f$ is the rate and @f$p_i@f$
 * is the probability of model i (@f$\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_i * \rho_i =
 * 1@f$), the rates are defined by relative rates parameters
 * @f$r_i@f$ (called "relratei") with:
 * @f[
 * 1 <= i < n, \rho_i = (1-r_1)*(1-r_2)...(1-r_{i-1})*\frac{r_{i}}{p_i}
 * @f]
 * @f[
 * \rho_n = \frac{(1-r_1)*(1-r_2)*...*(1-r_{n-1})}{p_n}
 * @f]
 * and
 * @f[
 * \forall 1 <= i < n, r_i = \frac{\rho_i*p_i}{1-(p_1*\rho_1+...+p_{i-1}*\rho_{i-1})} < 1.
 * @f]
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * Mixture(model1=HKY85(kappa=3), model2=T92(theta=0.1),
 *         model2=L95(gamma=2), relrate1=0.2, relrate2=0.9,
 *         relproba1=0.1,relproba2=0.8)
 *
 * define a model as a mixture of 3 different models: HKY85 has
 * probability 0.1 and rate 2, T92 has probability 0.4 and rate 1.8,
 * and L95 has probability 0.5 and rate 0.16.
 *
 *
 * The parameters are named \c "Mixture.relrate1", \c
 * "Mixture.relrate2", \c "Mixture.relproba1", \c
 * "Mixture.relproba2"... in addition to the parameters of the
 * submodels that are prefixed by "Mixture.i_", where i is the order
 * of the model.
