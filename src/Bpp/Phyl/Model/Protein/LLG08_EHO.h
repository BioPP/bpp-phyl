/**
 * @brief The Le et al  (2008) EH0 substitution model for proteins.
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * This model is a mixture of three models corresponding to
 * extended/helix/other sites in proteins. The models are considered
 * in this order.
 *
 *
 * This model includes 4 parameters :
 *
 * - relrate1 is the relative rate of model of extended sites;
 * - relrate2 is the relative rate of helix sites;
 * - relproba1 is the proportion  of extended sites;
 * - relproba2 is the ratio of the proportions of helix sites over the sum of
 * the proportion of helix sites plus the proportion of other sites.
 *
 * Important: See the relation between these parameters and the rates
 * and probabilities of the models in the description of
 * MixtureOfSubstitutionModels class.
