 * @brief The Jones, Taylor and Thornton substitution model for proteins.

 * Exchangeabilities have been computed using the DCMut method of Kosiol and Goldman.
 * The exchangability matrix is normalized so that \f$Q = S . \pi\f$ and \f$\sum_i Q_{i,i}\pi_i = -1\f$.
 * The original frequencies can be used, or alternatively a parametrized version, corresponding to the
 * so-called JTT92+F model.
 * Eigen values and vectors are obtained numerically.
