   * @brief The Dayhoff, Schwartz and Orcutt substitution model for proteins.
   *
   * Exchangeabilities have been computed using the DCMut method of Kosiol and Goldman.
   * The exchangability matrix is normalized so that \f$Q = S . \pi\f$ and \f$\sum_i Q_{i,i}\pi_i = -1\f$.
   * The original frequencies can be used, or alternatively a parametrized version, corresponding to the
   * so-called JTT92+F model.
   * Eigen values and vectors are obtained numerically.
