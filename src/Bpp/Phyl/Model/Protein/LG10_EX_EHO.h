/**
 * @brief The Le and Gascuel (2010) EX_EHO substitution model for proteins.
 * @author Mathieu Groussin
 *
 * This model is a mixture of six models. It combines two previously published models, EX2 and EHO.
 * Sites are classified as: exposed & extended, buried & extended, exposed & alpha-helix
 * buried & alpha-helix, exposed & other, or buried & other.
 * The submodels are called BUR_EXT, BUR_HEL, BUR_OTH, EXP_EXT, EXP_HEL and EXP_OTH.
 * 
 * The model includes 10 parameters :
 *
 * - relrate1 to relrate5 are the relative rates of the submodels;
 * - relproba1 to relproba5 are the relative proportions of the submodels;
 *
 * Important: See the relation between these parameters and the
 * rates and probabilities of the models in the description of
 * MixtureOfSubstitutionModels class.
