 * @brief The Le et al  (2008) UL2 substitution model for proteins.
 * @author Laurent Guéguen
 *
 * This model is a mixture of two models built by an unsupervised
 * method (see ref). The submodels are called M1 & M2.
 *
 *
 * This model includes 2 parameters :
 *
 * - relrate1 is the relative rate of model of M1;
 * - relproba1 is the proportion of model M1;
 *
 * Important: See the relation between these parameters and the
 * rates and probabilities of the models in the description of
 * MixtureOfSubstitutionModels class.
