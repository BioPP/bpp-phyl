/**
 * @brief This class is the core class inherited by the Coala class. COaLA is a branch-heterogeneous amino-acid substitution model.
 *
 * This class allows to compute the COA from the alignment, to define the parameter (axis positions), and implements a function used to compute the equilibrium frequencies from a set of
 * coordinates along the principal axes of the COA.
 *
 * @author Mathieu Groussin
 * @param nbAxes The number of principal axes of the COA that have to be taken into account to optimize the 20 branch-specific equilibrium frequencies. This number is common to all branches, as
 * well as on the root, where frequencies are optimized with a MVAprotein object (See the ProteinFrequenciesSet class).
 * @param exch The exchangeability matrix. The matrices currently available are DSO78, JTT92, WAG01 or LG08. A user-defined matrix can be specified with the 'file' argument.
