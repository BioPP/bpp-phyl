 * @brief This class implements the likelihood computation for a tree using the double-recursive
 * algorithm, allowing for non-homogeneous models of substitutions.
 *
 * The substitution model is the same over the tree (homogeneous model).
 * A non-uniform distribution of rates among the sites is allowed (ASRV models).</p>
 *
 * This class uses an instance of the DRASDRTreeLikelihoodData for conditionnal likelihood storage.
 *
 * All nodes share the same site patterns.
 *
 * Important note: The input tree will be considered as rooted, since the likelihood of non-stationary models
 * depends on the position of the root. If the input tree is not rooted, it will be considered as a rotted tree
 * with a root multifurcation.
