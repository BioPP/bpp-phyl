/**
 * @brief Interface for double-recursive (DR) implementation of the likelihood computation.
 *
 * In the DR implementation, three conditional likelihoods are stored at each node, corresponding to the three connected substrees
 * (in case of multifurcations, there may have even more).
 * The DR implementation hence uses 3x more memory than the simple recursive (R) implementation.
 * However, the likelihood of the tree can be computed independently at each node of the tree,
 * which is very convenient for topology estimation (the likelihood change of each NNI movement can be computed directly),
 * ancestral state reconstruction (all marginal ancestral states can be computed in one pass over the tree), or for
 * substitution mapping.
 *
 * This interface provides
 * - a method to access the DR likelihood data structure,
 * - a method to compute the likelihood array at each node.
 *
 * For now, this interface inherits from DiscreteRatesAcrossSitesTreeLikelihood and not TreeLikelihood,
 * since the data structure available accounts for rate across site variation.
 * This may change in the future.
 *
