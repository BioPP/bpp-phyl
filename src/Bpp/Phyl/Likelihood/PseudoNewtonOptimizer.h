   * @brief This Optimizer implements Newton's algorithm for finding a minimum of a function.
   * This is in fact a modified version of the algorithm, as suggested by Nicolas Galtier, for
   * the purpose of optimizing phylogenetic likelihoods.
   *
   * Only second simple order derivative are computed, no cross derivative, following Galtier's
   * algorithm.
   * Felsenstein and Churchill's (1996) correction is applied when new trial as a likelihood
   * lower than the starting point.
