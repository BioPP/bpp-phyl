  /**
   * @brief This class implement the 'traditional' way of computing likelihood for a tree.
   *
   * The substitution model is constant over the tree (homogeneous model).
   * A non uniform distribution of rates among the sites is allowed (ASRV models).</p>
   *
   * This class uses an instance of the DRASRTreeLikelihoodData for conditionnal likelihood storage.
   *
   * This class can also use a simple or recursive site compression.
   * In the simple case, computations for identical sites are not duplicated.
   * In the recursive case, computations for identical sub-sites (<i>site patterns </i>) are also not duplicated:
   * Following N. Galtier (personal communication ;-), we define a Pattern as a distinct site
   * in a sub-dataset corresponding to the dataset with sequences associated to a particular subtree.
   * The likelihood computation is the same for a given site, hence the idea is to save time from
   * performing many times the same coputation.
   * The network between all patterns is defined by the _patternLinks double map, initialized in the
   * initLikelihoodsWithPatterns() method. This initialisation takes more time than the classic
   * initTreeLikelihood one, where all likelihoods for a given site <i>i</i> are at the <i>i</i> coordinate
   * in the likelihood tensor, but is really faster when computing the likelihood (computeLikelihoods() method).
   * Hence, if you have to compute likelihood many times while holding the tree topology unchanged,
   * you should use patterns.
   * This decreases the likelihood computation time, but at a cost: some time is spent to establish the patterns
   * relationships. Whether to use or not patterns depends on what you actllay need:
   * - The more you compute likelihoods without changing the data or topology, the more patterns are interesting
   *   (this divides the cost of computing patterns by the number of computation performed).
   *   Patterns are hence usefull when you have a high number of computation to perform, while optimizing numerical
   *   parameters for instance).
   * - Patterns are more likely to occur whith small alphabet (nucleotides).
