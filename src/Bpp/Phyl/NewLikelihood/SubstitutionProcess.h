/**
 * @brief This interface describes the substitution process along the tree and sites of the alignment.
 *
 * It main purpose is to provide the necessary calculus for each branch-site-model class combination,
 * such as Markov generator and transition probabilities.
 * These are typically provided by a TransitionModel class, applied in various combination along the
 * tree (eg non-homogeneous models) and alignment (eg partition models).
 * The so-called "model class" refers to mixture models.
 *
 * An instance of the SubstitutionProcess class is always associated to an instance of a ParametrizableTree.
 * The substitution process is in charge of computing the transition probabilities for each branch of the tree,
 * and to update them in case a parameter (including branch length) changes.
 *
 * As several branches and sites can share the same generator/transition probabilities, calling these values
 * and therefore performing the underlying calculation for each branch-site can result in a very unefficient
 * code. Therefore, "model iterators" are provided, to allow smarter loops over the model structure,
 * by minimizing the amount of computation to be done.
 * Such iterator allow to loop over branches and sites in a clever way, through both directions, but do not
 * perform any calculations.
 * These are achieved through calls to the corresponding SubstitutionProcess class.
