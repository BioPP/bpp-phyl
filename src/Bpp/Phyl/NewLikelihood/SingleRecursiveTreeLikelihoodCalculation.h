/**
 * @brief This class implements the single recursion likelihood computation for a tree.
 *
 * This class uses an instance of the SingleRecursiveTreeLikelihoodData for conditionnal likelihood storage.
 *
 * This class can also use a simple or recursive site compression.
 * In the simple case, computations for identical sites are not duplicated.
 * In the recursive case, computations for identical sub-sites (<i>site patterns </i>) are also not duplicated:
 * Following N. Galtier (personal communication), we define a Pattern as a distinct site
 * in a sub-dataset corresponding to the dataset with sequences associated to a particular subtree.
 * The likelihood computation is the same for a given site, hence the idea is to save time from
 * performing many times the same coputation.
 * The network between all patterns is defined by the _patternLinks double map, initialized in the
 * initLikelihoodsWithPatterns() method. This initialisation takes more time than the classic
 * initTreeLikelihood one, where all likelihoods for a given site <i>i</i> are at the <i>i</i> coordinate
 * in the likelihood tensor, but is really faster when computing the likelihood (computeLikelihoods() method).
 * Hence, if you have to compute likelihood many times while holding the tree topology unchanged,
 * you should use patterns.
 * This decreases the likelihood computation time, but at a cost: some time is spent to establish the patterns
 * relationships. Whether to use or not patterns depends on what you actllay need:
 * - The more you compute likelihoods without changing the data or topology, the more patterns are interesting
 *   (this divides the cost of computing patterns by the number of computation performed).
 *   Patterns are hence usefull when you have a high number of computation to perform, while optimizing numerical
 *   parameters for instance).
 * - Patterns are more likely to occur whith small alphabet (nucleotides).
 *
 * Important note: The input tree will be considered as rooted, since the likelihood of non-stationary models
 * depends on the position of the root. If the input tree is not rooted, it will be considered as a rooted tree
 * with a root multifurcation.
