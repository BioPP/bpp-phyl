   * @brief The SubstitutionsCount interface.
   *
   * Provide a method to compute the @f$n_{x,y}(t)@f$ function,
   * namely the number of substitutions on a branch of length @f$t@f$, with initial state @f$x@f$ and final state @f$y@f$.
   * 
   * The new implementation offers to perform several counts simultaneously, distinguishing between different types of substitutions. Therefore substitution count object takes as input a SubstitutionRegister, which describes all
   * types of substitutions and associate them with an index. All counts can be retrieved in one go as a vector, the type serving as an indice.
