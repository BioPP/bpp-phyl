 * @brief Data storage class for probabilistic substitution mappings.
 *
 * A 'probabilistic' mapping contains an single value for each branch and each site.
 * This number can be an average number of substitutions, optionally waited, or a probability of observing a certain number of substitutions.
 * Probabilistic was coined there by opposition to the'stochastic' mapping, where a path (number of susbstitutions + there position along the branch)
 * is available for each branch and site. The probabilistic mapping can however be extended to contain a matrix will all types of substitutions, instead of their total number.
