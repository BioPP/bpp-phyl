 * @brief Basic implementation of dendrogram plots.
 *
 * Dendrograms are oriented plots, with all the leaves on one side of the plot, and the root node at the opposite side.
 * This implementation offers to option for ploting form left to right or right to left. This will affect the direction
 * of plot annotations. The drawing can always be transformed using the regular translation/rotation operation on the
 * GraphicDevice.
