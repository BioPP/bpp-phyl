/**
 * @brief The so-called 'newick' parenthetic format.
 *
 * Branch lengths and bootstraps are supported:
 *
 * ex:
 * <code>
 * ((A:0.1, B:0.15)90:0.2, C:0.27);
 * </code>
 *
 * Code example:
 * @code
 * #include <Phyl/Newick.h>
 * #include <Phyl/Tree.h>
 * 
 * Newick * newickReader = new Newick(false); //No comment allowed!
 * try {
 * 	Tree * tree = newickReader->read("MyTestTree.dnd"); // Tree in file MyTestTree.dnd
 * 	cout << "Tree has " << tree->getNumberOfLeaves() << " leaves." << endl;
 * } catch (Exception e) {
 *	cout << "Error when reading tree." << endl;
 * }
 * delete tree;
 * delete newickReader;
 * @endcode
 *
 * Bootstrap values are stored as node properties, as Number<double> objects and with the tag TreeTools::BOOTSTRAP.
 *
 * This is also possible to read a "tagged" tree, where additional info is provided in place of bootstrap values:
 * ((A,B)N2,(C,D)N3)N1;
 * This is achieved by calling the enableExtendedBootstrapProperty method, and providing a property name to use.
 * The additional information will be stored at each node as a property, in a String object.
 * The disableExtendedBootstrapProperty method restores the default behavior.
