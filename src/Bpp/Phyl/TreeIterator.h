/**
 * @brief The phylogenetic tree iterator class.
 *
 * This class is part of the object implementation of phylogenetic trees.
 *
 * The class offers iterators for traversing the nodes in a tree in 3 possible orders:
 * Post-Order
 * Pre-Order
 * In-Order
 *
 * For more information on using trees in BIo++,
 * @see Node
 * @see NodeTemplate
 * @see TreeTools
