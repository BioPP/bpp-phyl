	 * Defined for double, VectorDouble, MatrixDouble.
	 * For composite types, delta will be added to all elements.
	 * It performs: <coeffs>(lambda, deps) -> lambda * sum_i (deps[i] * coeffs[i]).
	 *
	 * Should only be used to compute numerical derivatives of functions.
	 * This is used to combine the values from the function computed in different points.
	 * Lambda is intended to be 1/delta^n, where delta is the shift value.
	 *
	 * Lambda is a special argument (not derivable, etc).
	 * Construction will merge layers of consecutive NumericalDerivationCombineShifted.
