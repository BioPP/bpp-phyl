	/** Base data flow Node class.
	 * All data flow nodes inherit from this class.
	 * Instances of this class must be used through std::shared_ptr<T>.
	 *
	 * A base node represents something that can be computed from its dependencies.
	 * The computation is defined by the compute() method in derived classes.
	 *
	 * The base class stores a boolean indicating if the current value is valid.
	 * This boolean is used to cache intermediate results in the graph, and avoid recomputings.
	 * When data flow graph leaves change, they invalidate (transitively) dependent nodes.
	 * This means setting the valid flag to false, to trigger a recomputation at next access.
	 *
	 * Each node has dependencies: other nodes providing data it needs to compute.
	 * These dependencies are stored as NodeRef (shared_ptr<Node>).
	 * Thus, multiple nodes can depend on the same value, to shared intermediate results.
	 * The list of dependencies is FIXED at creation, and cannot be changed.
	 * Changing the meaning of a node (dependencies, config) is done by creating a different node.
	 *
	 * Nodes also store pointers to dependent nodes.
	 * Dependent nodes are nodes which have a direct dependency to the current node.
	 * This is used to propagate invalidations to all transitive dependent nodes of a leaf.
	 * Dependent nodes are stored as raw pointers (no ownership).
	 *
	 * Base nodes thus store the data flow graph topology, in terms of pointer to base Node.
	 * This is useful for code reuse: no templates in topology walks code.
	 * It is useful for debugging: can print the whole graph structure.
	 * Accessing the derived classes (for compute) can be done efficiently with static_cast.
	 *
	 * Specific features are present in the base class as virtual functions.
	 * This include derivation (numerical values), information (debug, name, isConstant...).
	 * These features have no-op defaults which can be overriden if meaningful in derived classes.
