   * Equilibrium frequencies are stored as a RowVector(nbState) : matrix with 1 row and n columns.
   * This choice allows to reuse the MatrixProduct numeric node directly.

   * Initial conditional likelihood for leaves (sequences on the tree) should be computed outside of the
   * dataflow graph, and provided as NumericConstant<MatrixXd>.
